# A Kalman Filter application for GNSS error correction in Intelligent Vehicles
This repository contains the code implementation of the developed Kalman Filters for my Bachelor Thesis in 2020 at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.



## Purpose
The project consists on the utilisation of Kalman Filters for correcting GPS positioning errors when a vehicle drives in urban and interurban environments. The data is owned by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and was collected in Madrid city, Legan√©s and roads between these two cities in the Madrid Region in Spain.
